Build a Chrome Extension named 'Focus Guard' using Manifest V3.Core Objective: The extension should prevent 'semantic drift' by using AI to analyze if the user's current webpage content matches their self-defined study/work goal.Technical Requirements:Popup UI: Create a clean React-based popup where a user inputs their current 'Focus Goal' (e.g., 'Researching Neural Networks'). Include a 'Start Session' and 'End Session' button.Background Script (Service Worker): Monitor tab updates and injections.Content Script: Extract the main text content from the active tab (prioritizing headings and paragraph tags) every time a new URL is loaded or the tab is switched.AI/ML Logic (The 'Drift' Detector): >    - Implement a function that sends the 'Focus Goal' and the 'Scraped Page Content' to an LLM (use OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini or a local Transformers.js model for embedding comparison).The AI must return a JSON object: { "is_on_track": boolean, "relevance_score": 0-100, "reason": "string" }.If is_on_track is false for 2 consecutive checks, trigger an overlay.The Nudge Overlay: If drift is detected, inject a non-intrusive modal over the current webpage with a message like: 'You seem to be drifting into [Detected Topic]. Would you like to get back to [Goal]?' Include a 'Return to Focus' button and a 'Snooze for 5 mins' button.Privacy: Ensure the text extraction happens locally and only the necessary context is sent to the API.Please provide the manifest.json, the background service worker logic, the content script for text extraction, and the React component for the popup."🧠 Your AI/ML Implementation StrategySince your background is in AI/ML, here are two ways you can handle the "Brain" of this extension:Option A: The API Approach (Easier)Use OpenAI or Anthropic APIs.Pros: High accuracy, handles complex topics easily.Cons: Latency and API costs.Key Prompt for the AI: "Compare this goal: 'Learning Python' with this webpage text: [Text]. Are they semantically related? Answer only Yes or No."Option B: The Local ML Approach (Cooler/Privacy-First)Use Transformers.js to run models directly in the browser.How: Load a small embedding model like all-MiniLM-L6-v2.Logic: 1.  Convert the Goal into a vector $v_{goal}$.2.  Convert the Webpage Text into a vector $v_{page}$.3.  Calculate the Cosine Similarity between them.4.  If the similarity score falls below a threshold (e.g., $0.5$), trigger the nudge.💡 Pro-Tip for your ProjectTo make this truly "AI-powered," don't just block the site. Have the AI suggest a "Bridge Action." If the user is on a gaming site instead of studying Physics, the nudge could say: "Hey, you're looking at games. Did you know the physics engine in this game uses the same Tensor calculus you were just studying? Want to go back to the lecture?
